Positioning Statement

AJNETWORKS offers managed and outsourced technology services as a secondary, optional engagement layer, designed to support business continuity after strategy or delivery engagements.

These services are consulting-governed, security-led, and outcome-driven.
AJNETWORKS does not operate as a low-level IT support vendor.

Outsourced services are provided either:

Directly by AJNETWORKS, or

Through vetted partners, under AJNETWORKS oversight, standards, and accountability.

Purpose of This Offering

Managed and outsourced services exist to:

Ensure continuity of critical systems

Reduce operational risk

Provide ongoing technical stewardship

Protect long-term technology investments

They are positioned as business enablement services, not ad-hoc technical labor.

Managed & Outsourced Service Categories

1. Website & Application Maintenance

Post-launch support and system upkeep

Bug fixes, repairs, and incremental improvements

Performance and availability monitoring

Controlled updates aligned to business priorities

2. Hosting & Infrastructure Management

Hosting provider selection and coordination

Engagement Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Managed and outsourced services are never marketed as cheap labor

AJNETWORKS remains accountable for quality, security, and delivery

All engagements operate under:

Defined scope

Service-level expectations (SLAs)

Clear escalation paths

Cybersecurity and networking standards apply to all managed work

Website Presentation Rules

On the website, these services must be presented as:

“Managed Technology & Operations Support”

Positioned as an extension of consulting and delivery

Avoid standalone labels such as:

“Outsourcing Services”

## 7. Technology Stack (Consulting-Grade)

The stack reflects **credibility, performance, and scalability**, not trends.

### Frontend

- Next.js (React)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

### CMS

- Headless CMS (Sanity or Strapi)

### Backend & Engineering Layer

- Node.js (API & integrations)
- Python (automation, data, tooling where required)

### Infrastructure & Networking

- Vercel (frontend)
- Cloud providers (AWS / GCP depending on client)
- Secure networking practices (firewalls, VPNs, segmentation)

### Security

- HTTPS, CSP, secure headers
- OWASP-aligned application security
- Secure authentication patterns

---

### Frontend (refactored to match this project's technologies)

- Stack: Static HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla JavaScript (no framework). No build tooling required — pages are served as static files.
- File layout:
  - Root styling: style.css (imports Google fonts Montserrat / Nunito; brand overrides live here).
  - Vendor CSS: css/bootstrap.min.css, css/font-awesome.min.css, css/flaticon.css, css/owl.carousel.min.css, css/magnific-popup.css, css/royal-preload.css, plus Revolution CSS under plugins/revolution/revolution/css/.
  - Vendor JS: js/jquery.min.js, plugin files under js/ and plugins/, and project scripts in js/scripts.js and js/header-mobile.js.
  - Assets: images/ with slider/, projects/, blog/, background/, client-logos/ subfolders. Keep hero ~1920px wide and update data-thumb for slider images.
- Header/footer:
  - Header, mobile header and footer are duplicated per page. Keep navigation links and contact info (+254 758 238 617, jabrahamjohns@gmail.com) synced across pages when editing.
- Hero slider:
  - Home uses <div id="rev_slider_one"> and li slides (rs-70..72). Add slides following existing li structure and data-\* animation attributes; update data-thumb when swapping images.
- Script load order (required):
  1. js/jquery.min.js
  2. plugin scripts (jquery.magnific-popup.min.js, jquery.isotope.min.js, owl.carousel.min.js, easypiechart.min.js, jquery.countdown.min.js, etc.)
  3. plugins/revolution/revolution/js/\* (Revolution core files)
  4. js/rev-script-2.js (home slider config) or rev-script-3.js where applicable
  5. js/scripts.js
  6. js/header-mobile.js
  - Initialize royal_preloader inline immediately after loading js/royal_preloader.min.js.
- Components & classes to preserve:
  - Use existing utility classes (space-20, space-5, container, row, col-\*, video-popup).
  - Preserve brand-related classes and tokens: main-heading, slider-tag-line, octf-btn and its variants.
  - Prefer class-based styling; avoid new inline styles except minimal logo color tweaks.
- Carousels & grids:
  - Use .owl-carousel markup and mirror existing item/data attributes for spacing and autoplay consistency.
  - Portfolio grid should be filterable via the existing isotope/js patterns.
- Forms:
  - Newsletter, contact and header search remain static (action="#"). Integrations require adding real endpoints and JS.
- Performance & assets:
  - Optimize images for web, reuse existing vendor bundles, and avoid adding new libraries.
- Running locally:
  - Open HTML files directly in a browser or serve the folder with a simple static server (no npm installs or build steps).
- Development guidance:
  - Keep primary custom CSS in style.css and behavior tweaks in js/scripts.js / js/header-mobile.js / rev-script-\*.js.
  - When changing shared layout (header/footer), update all pages.
- Accessibility & SEO:
  - Update <title> and meta per page; maintain meaningful alt text on replaced images.

This replaces the previous Next.js/TypeScript/Tailwind frontend recommendation with the project's actual static HTML/CSS/JS architecture and conventions.

AJNETWORKS — PRICING, COMMERCIAL MODEL & CLIENT QUALIFICATION (MASTER) 31. Pricing Philosophy (Authoritative)

AJNETWORKS pricing reflects strategic responsibility, delivery risk, and business impact, not hours worked or tools used.

We do not sell development time.
We deliver outcomes, systems, and accountability.

All pricing is:

Consulting-led

Scope-defined

Risk-adjusted

Security-inclusive by default

This pricing framework supports regional and international engagements without repositioning or renegotiation.

32. Website Pricing FAQs (Client-Facing, Approved Copy)
    FAQ 1: Why are prices listed in USD?

AJNETWORKS works with clients across multiple regions. USD pricing provides a consistent international reference and reflects our positioning as a technology consulting firm. Local billing may be converted where required.

FAQ 2: Do you offer fixed pricing?

Yes — after scope definition.

All fixed prices are based on:

Business objectives

Technical complexity

Security and infrastructure considerations

Delivery risk and accountability

We do not quote blindly.

FAQ 3: Do you charge hourly?

No.

Hourly billing misaligns incentives and undervalues strategic responsibility. AJNETWORKS prices engagements based on value delivered, not time consumed.

FAQ 4: Can pricing be adjusted for startups or NGOs?

Yes — selectively.

We support mission-aligned and early-stage organizations through:

Reduced consulting scope

Phased delivery

Flexible payment structures

We do not provide free services or informal discounts.

FAQ 5: What does pricing include?

Unless explicitly excluded, pricing includes:

Strategic input

Engineering execution

Security-by-design

Deployment readiness

Knowledge transfer where appropriate

FAQ 6: Is cybersecurity priced separately?

No.

Cybersecurity and infrastructure considerations are embedded into every engagement. Standalone security projects are priced only when security is the primary scope.

FAQ 7: What happens after delivery?

Clients may opt into:

Managed support retainers

Infrastructure oversight

Security and patch management

Fractional technology leadership

These are offered only after successful delivery.

33. Pricing Objection Handling (Internal & Sales Use)
    Objection: “You are more expensive than other developers.”

Response:
We are not competing with developers. AJNETWORKS operates as a consulting-led engineering firm. Our pricing reflects strategic accountability, security responsibility, and long-term system reliability.

Objection: “Another firm quoted less.”

Response:
That may be appropriate for their delivery model. Our engagements include consulting oversight, architecture responsibility, and security-by-design. We encourage clients to compare scope, not price.

Objection: “Can you reduce the price?”

Response:
We can reduce scope or phase delivery. We do not reduce responsibility without adjusting engagement terms.

Objection: “Can we start small?”

Response:
Yes. We recommend beginning with a strategy or assessment engagement to define a focused, lower-risk starting point.

Objection: “Why not hourly?”

Response:
Hourly billing incentivizes inefficiency and removes accountability. We price for outcomes and delivery ownership.
